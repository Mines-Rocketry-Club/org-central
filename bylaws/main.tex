%\todo{No provision to prevent running for all positions. Should this get fixed?}
{Election Procedures:}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item An in-person election will be held over two subsequent regular club meetings in March, 
    or earlier if required, prior to club form submittal. 
    \item An email will be sent one month before the first day of the elections, most likely at the beginning of February, 
    to the club members to tell them the election will take place and encourage candidates to run. 
    A reminder will be sent out one week in advance and another one day in advance of the first day of the election.
    \item Candidates must nominate themselves. 
    All qualifications must be met as described in Article IV, Section B of these bylaws. 
    \item If a potential qualified candidate cannot attend the election, 
    then they may email the current president and the current vice president their intent to run, 
    position they intend to run for, and the reason why they cannot attend. 
    The president will ensure that their name is added to the ballot and the vice president will ensure that it is done accurately.
    \item The election will be held in person where attendants will cast their votes on one club-combined ballot. 
    Voters will put a tally next to the name of the candidate for each position they wish to vote for. 
    Each voter may only vote once per position but may vote for all positions. 
    This will be done in a public setting. 
    Voters may only change or remove their vote if it is certain by all other voters that they did in fact vote for the tally that they are removing their vote from.
    \item If a regular member cannot attend the election, 
    they may email the current president and vice president their desire to vote. 
    The president will respond notifying them of the candidates for each position in a timely manner. 
    The regular member then may email the current president and vice president the candidates they wish to vote for. 
    The president will ensure that their votes are counted on the ballot and the vice president will ensure their accuracy.
    \item The completed ballot will be publicly displayed after the election is completed. 
    Whichever candidate receives a plurality of the votes cast will become the officer-elect for that position. 
    If there are more than two candidates for the same position and no one candidate received over 50\% of the total votes cast, 
    then the president may call a runoff election instead if deemed necessary. 
    If there is a tie, then the current officers will decide among themselves who wins the election.
    \item The new officers will be communicated to SAIL as required.
\end{enumerate}
To continue with club operations, it is critical that a President, Treasurer, and Safety Officer be elected. 
Other officer positions shall be filled only if there is a qualified candidate for each of these three positions.
